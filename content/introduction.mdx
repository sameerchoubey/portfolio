I have been thinking for a while about starting a personal website where I can host my projects and share my thoughts. I was looking for more of a hybrid version where I can do both.

If you've just landed here, let me give you a small introduction about myself.

My name is Sameer, and I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) from NIT Sikkim. The worst thing about this is that I am graduating this summer.

In a 4-year course, I spent only 2.5 years in college, and it seems that the remaining few months will also be spent at home due to my college not reopening, even though the government has allowed them to do so.

I have been watching sports for over a decade now. I live in India, where cricket is the de-facto national sport, and I have been closely following our national cricket team for the last 16 years.

> It started with watching a guy with big hair scoring an unbeaten 183 against Sri Lanka in Jaipur. That day (in the 2000s), I became an MS Dhoni fan. I was just 7 years old.

Though, I became a little disconnected after the World Cup semi-final loss against NZ. Everyone was asking me why Dhoni wasn't playing and why he hadn't been dropped from the team. Deep down, I knew that it would be his last match, and I felt the same.

Other than being a de-facto cricket fan, I am a huge Manchester United fan (a.k.a. The Red Devils). If you cut my veins, they'll bleed red (I know that was a bad joke, but it's true). I have been following football for about 5 years now and have been closely following United for the last 2 years.

I hope to see you around :)
