summary: "Reflecting on my 6-month internship journey at OnJuno, where I contributed to building core systems and grew as a software engineer."

I joined OnJuno as an SDE Intern in November’20 (shortly before the public launch of the core product) and it’s been an amazing journey till now.

### How It Started
I am a firm believer in great products, so, when I saw the website of OnJuno for the first time; I really liked it. The next thing that I did was sent a DM to Varun Deshpande (our CEO) for an internship. He was kind enough to respond and schedule an interview for me.

Fast forward two days later, I got my interview scheduled with Ratnesh Ray (our CTO) and a couple more interviews later, I received an internship offer, which I accepted straight away.

### What I Worked On
During my 6 months at OnJuno, I contributed to several key projects:

1. **Metabase Queries**  
   I wrote a *lot* of Metabase queries to help the team analyze data and make informed decisions.

2. **Internal CRM Portal**  
   I worked on building an internal CRM portal for the customer support team. This project introduced me to **Vue.js**, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The portal is still a work in progress, but I’m proud of what my mentor, **Shubham Sharma**, and I built together.

### Key Learnings
- **Mentorship Matters**: A huge thank you to my mentor, **Shubham Sharma**, for guiding me throughout this journey.
- **Real-World Impact**: Seeing my work directly improve the efficiency of the customer support team was incredibly rewarding.
- **Growth Mindset**: I learned to embrace challenges and continuously improve my skills.

### What's Next
I'm thrilled to share that I've received a full-time offer from OnJuno as a **Software Development Engineer**. Despite having three other offers from campus placements, I've decided to continue my journey with OnJuno after graduation.

I'm really excited about what lies ahead and can't wait to contribute to OnJuno's mission of building innovative financial solutions.
